A probabilistic framework for **early detection of cyber-attack stages** in network telemetry using **Switching State-Space Models (SSSM)**.

The system models network traffic as a **temporal stochastic process** and infers hidden regimes such as reconnaissance, intrusion attempts, and data exfiltration. By tracking regime transitions over time, the model can identify attacks **before they fully manifest**.

# Project Overview

Enterprise networks generate continuous streams of telemetry such as:

* packet counts
* connection rates
* authentication events
* protocol distributions
* flow statistics

Most intrusion detection systems operate using:

* static thresholds
* rule-based alerts
* supervised classification

These approaches often detect attacks **only after clear anomalies appear**.

This project instead models network behavior as a **dynamic probabilistic system** where the true network condition is hidden and must be inferred from noisy observations.

The objective is to estimate:

* hidden operational regimes of the network
* transition probabilities between regimes
* early indicators of attack progression

---

# Attack Regime Modeling

Many cyber attacks follow multi-stage progression:

1. **Normal operation**
2. **Reconnaissance / scanning**
3. **Initial intrusion attempts**
4. **Privilege escalation**
5. **Lateral movement**
6. **Data exfiltration**

Rather than detecting isolated events, this project models **attack progression as regime transitions in a temporal process**.

# Mathematical Formulation

The system is modeled as a **latent dynamical process**.

### State Dynamics

[
x_t = A_{s_t} x_{t-1} + w_t
]

Where:

* (x_t) = hidden network state
* (A_{s_t}) = regime-specific transition matrix
* (w_t) = process noise

---

### Observation Model

[
y_t = C_{s_t} x_t + v_t
]

Where:

* (y_t) = observed network telemetry
* (C_{s_t}) = observation matrix
* (v_t) = measurement noise

---

### Regime Transition

[
P(s_t | s_{t-1})
]

Modeled as a **Markov transition matrix**.

Each regime corresponds to an attack stage such as:

* normal
* scanning
* intrusion
* exfiltration

---

# Inference Methods

Hidden states and regime probabilities are estimated using:

* Kalman Filter
* Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
* Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)
* Variational Switching Kalman Filter

These methods estimate:

* posterior state distribution
* probability of each regime
* regime transition timing

---

# Datasets

The system is evaluated using public intrusion detection datasets.

### CICIDS2017

A widely used dataset containing modern attack scenarios.

Includes attacks such as:

* brute force
* DoS
* infiltration
* port scanning
* botnet activity

---

### UNSW-NB15

A benchmark dataset with modern attack patterns.

Features include:

* packet statistics
* flow metadata
* protocol behavior

# Regime Detection Visualization

Example visualization showing how the model tracks **probabilities of hidden attack regimes over time**.
Each line represents the inferred probability of a regime.

* Normal traffic
* Scanning / reconnaissance
* Intrusion attempts
* Data exfiltration

![Regime Detection](docs/regime_detection.gif)

The model continuously updates regime probabilities as new telemetry arrives, allowing detection of attack progression before the attack fully develops.
